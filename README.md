Create todo list app using modules while ultilizing npm/webpack. 


9/5
idea:   order cards a-z first always, then by date, then by filter? by id?

bug?:   if no tasks for a project, project deletes from project list (need empty projects? probably)
bug:    can input empty project in dropdown selection

note:   edit line button needs to adjust for date and priority

need:   "Users should be able to create new projects and choose which project their todos go into."
        -project list need delete button (and confirm)
        -need "add project" in project list
        -need drop down for project input

9/10 
need:   sidebar project list needs edit but that can change name of project (which changes all the project names of the cards it has also)
        the delete button can be hidden inside the edit version of the button

        todo card project edit needs dropdown only (only add project at sidebar)
