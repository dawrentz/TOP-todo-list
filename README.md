Create todo list app using modules while ultilizing npm/webpack. 


9/5
idea:   order cards a-z first always, then by date, then by filter?

bug?:   if no tasks for a project, project deletes from project list (need empty projects? probably)

note:   edit line button needs to adjust for date and priority
