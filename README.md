Create todo list app using modules while ultilizing npm/webpack. 


9/5
idea:   order cards a-z first always, then by date, then by filter? by id?

bug?:   if no tasks for a project, project deletes from project list (need empty projects? probably)

note:   edit line button needs to adjust for date and priority

need:   "Users should be able to create new projects and choose which project their todos go into."
        -project list needs to not clear everytime
        -need "add project" in project list
        -need drop down for project input
